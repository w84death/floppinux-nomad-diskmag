# PERFECT WORD EDITOR
I like to write on a computer. I mostly write about my hobbies like 
programming and FPV drones. I rarely use any graphics nor images in the 
articles. I grow in the DOS era with a black-and-white monitor. I'm a Linux 
guy. I'm used to text and command line. When If I ever need to format the 
document I would use markdown syntax. I think I just like the simplicity 
and compatibility with text files. Basically any computer no matter how 
simple or complex can read text files. I use plane English so I don't need 
to worry about UTF8 support.  Even if I needed some special characters UTF8 
is widely supported in the 2021.

The beauty of editing text files is that I do not need any complicated word 
processor. All I need is a clean and simple command line editor. Over the 
years I used three of them: WordGrinder, VIM and nano. Each have it's 
unique features.

## Wordgrinder
WordGrinder is good when you want something that is closer to word 
processing - with text styling and pages. It is fast and very intuitive. 
The official description (in the repository) says it all: "simple word 
processor for writing first drafts". What I did not like is that it uses 
it's own file format that can be readed only in the Wordgrinder itself. I 
ended up having two versions of the file .wg and .txt.

## Vim
Most fameous for not allowing users to quit the application. It's a joke as 
you need to know the special key combination to do that. To do anything at 
all. The learning curve is almost like a vertical wall - extremely hard at 
start. But when you know how to use it there is nothing out there that can 
compete. This is my main editor for configuration files. It is included in 
any Linux distribution - even those that fits on a 3.5" floppy. 
Unfortunately for editing longer texts it's too complicated.

## Nano
And here comes the nano. It is this perfect balance between super simple 
while having all the advanced features when needed. It is the default 
editor for Raspberry Pi OS. It looks a little bit like father of all 
editors: WordStar (DOS). It has menu with all the important shortcuts at 
the bottom. Also there is very good help when I forgot some shortcut.

I really like it because of the workflow it provides. It starts as a blank 
page. Then I enable word wrapping [alt]+[$] and line numbers [alt]+[#]. I 
then write a paragraph of text. When I done with it I like to make it 
justify (to the terminal width) for better readibility using [ctrl]+[j]. 
When I edit given paragraph I justify again and the text is perfectly 
shuffled to look good. There is even a spell checker [ctrl]+[t]. It only 
search for unknown words but that is enough for the draft stage.

All the commands are shortcut based using [ctrl] or [alt]. Always showing a 
list of them at the bottom with easy to understand descriptions. So I do 
not need to learn all of them it comes naturally over time as most 
shortcuts are the first letter of an English word.

I totally get why George R.R. Martin still uses WordStar in DOS to write his books. 
Any additional GUI is just not needed and compromise the screen size. As a bonus 
using those extremely light applications means they will run on anything. I have my 
favorite laptop - a 10" Fujitsu Siemens Lifebook p1610 that has 1Ghz CPU and 1GB of 
RAM. Super slow for todays software. But using Raspberry OS with terminal software 
it super smooth and to this day can run 5h on the original battery. It is my 
favorite hardware for outdoors.

## Summary
Low end computer with Linux and nano editor is my equivalent of a mobile 
typewriter.

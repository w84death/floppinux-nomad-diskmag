# Introduction to the Diskmag
## Krzysztof Krystian Jankowski

As a hacker, I like to challenge myself for learning new things. I also like to 
write about the stuff I do. Combining those two I came up with a diskmag - digital 
magazine. In the days of glory, those zines were distributed on tapes and 
discettes. To keep this project in the mood I also want to share the sources on 
the real floppy.

I have many web pages and blogs where I could publish my articles. But none of 
those are cool enough to beat a real diskmag :)

My goal was to be as compatible as possible. And the only solution was to make my 
own linux distribution that will boot from the diskmag floppy. As you can see I 
manage to fit this whole magazine with working OS on one 1.44MB floppy disk.

It boots super slimmed Linux kernel 5.13 (latest) and uses virtual rootfs file 
with all the tools needed to run magazine scripts. After boot it runs hush shell 
that runs main script. From that point it works as a kiosk software - user - can 
only interact with the main app to read included articles.

Making this all works was an incredible oportunity to learn Linux. In the end I 
created a simple and clean list of steps to recreate my work. It is published at 
https://bits.p1x.in if you are intrested in making super small operating systems.

This is the #0 issue. A pilot. I prepared few exclusive articles for it. In the future I will be happy to include any of your submisions. Email them to kj@p1x.in.

Enjoy reading.

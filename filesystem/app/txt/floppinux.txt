# FLOPPINUX
I grow up with a PC in home. This was the Intel 486 and MS DOS era. Software comes 
on 1.44MB 3.5" floppy disks. I even remember the 5.2" black, paper like floppies 
before that. But most of my childhood I was using the now classic "save icon" 
floppies.

As a nerd I love old technologies. Especially the one that just works to this day. 
Floppy disks are one of those. I bought an USB external FDD drive for them to use on 
any modern computer.

I got the drive, I got a bunch of floppies (new and used). So what now?

## The projects
I started two projects that I want to put on the floppy. A Nomad Diskmag and a 
custom made Linux. Each should be delivered on a one floppy disk. Lets concentrate 
on the later.

## 1.44MB Operating System
Yes, you can fit the latest Linux on a floppy. And there is still all lot of space 
for user applications. Having this I tought to make a some sort of a demo disk. 
Putting my texts from the Nomad Diskmag on the floppy with some super simple 
reader. I can then boot a computer from the floppy right to the magazine. Just for 
fun and learning new things. And there is a lot of things to learn.

### The kernel
I was blown away that I can use the latest and greatest Linux kernel in this 
project. It has a config for embedded devices. Just with few simple settings and a 
few minutes of compilation I got the bzImage that uses 632KB of space!

### BusyBox and Initramfs
Kernel is not enough, it also needs some directory structure and basic 
applications. GNU utilities are the best but way too big for embedded world. That's 
why community created BusyBox - a small subset of essential software that replace 
GNU. This is not 100% replacement more like a light version of each GNU tool. But 
powerfull enough to make an fully functional operating system. Should we name it 
BusyBox/Linux then? ;)

### Progress
I spend few evening reading a lot of forums, blog posts and manuals. Step by step 
I was able to create a simple steps for building this distribuion from scratch. I 
documented this on my blog at bits.p1x.in [0]. I highly recommend reading it and 
creating your own little operating system alongside.
 
## But really, why?
Is this work needed to anyone? Probably not. For me it's just for fun and 
learning. And without artificial restrictions I become bored and lost creativity. 
That is why my projects are always strange. But I like it that way. If you never 
tried restricting yoursel just do it - you'll be suprised by the outcoms.
